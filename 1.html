    <h2>HTML</h2>

    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
    With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.[4]</p>

    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
